i bleed it out digging deeper just to throw it away
leave out all the rest
there no blood there no alibi you there
crawling in my skin
is be more like me and be less like you

going my eyes are wide awake
who cares if one more light goes out
i know what worth fighting for end
thinking everythings about me
but i know yeah i know yeah i know
and i about to break
help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
i can feel the way i did before
so say goodbye and hit the road
i can feel the way i did before
shut up
turn your back on me i be less
burn it down
i can feel the way i did before
good goodbye
pick myself up off the ground
you can come back around here
make way for the new queen


why is everything so heavy
i know what worth fighting for end
you come back no more
this is not the end this is not the beginning
so i breaking the habit
for my battle symphony
but you keep spinning me just the same
why is everything so heavy
i know what worth fighting for end
i become so numb i can feel there can
i wanna heal i wanna feel like i close something my real
and i about to break
all the world in front of me
good goodbye
the hardest part of ending starting starting again
were you there for him
and this is how it ends
what i done
saying everything i said
it like i can stop what i i i was the was the
i can be who you are
so i let go watching you
i wanna fall wide awake

but i know yeah i know yeah i know
shut up
na na na na
i know what worth fighting for end
the clock ticks life away it so unreal so
and i about to
and i about to break
half pulled myself that far
less i hear the less you say
it like i can stop what i i i was the was
the truth is you turn into someone else
turn your back on me i be less
but i know yeah i know yeah i know
that im marching to the rhythm
nobody can save me
and you were there at the turn

for my battle symphony
you can come back around here
and i about to break
you come back no more
na na na na
make way for the new queen
we can wait to burn it to the ground
it like i can stop what i i i was the was
when they turn down the lights

and you were there at the turn

i only a crack in this castle of of glass

so i breaking the habit


it like i can stop what i i i was the was the

that everyone can save me now
i know what worth fighting for end

i holding up a light
but i know yeah i know yeah i know

all the ways that i keep losing you
i wanna heal i wanna feel like i the was new
it like i can stop what i i i was the was
never seen a young black in this
it like i can stop what i i i was the was
i cant escape the gravity
i know what worth fighting for end
just to throw it away just to throw it away
